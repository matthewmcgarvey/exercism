## I guess I will use this as a place to put my thoughts on the languages I have used

### Kotlin

Kotlin has become my favorite language.  I love the usage of scope.  I have never had to think in this way before and I love it.
I am currently using vscode with the kotlin plugin to do the coding so I am assuming that it's much easier to do kotlin in Intellij but it
has been very hard to figure out how to do method references and when I need to return something or when I shouldn't (i.e. `buildSequence` shouldn't use return for some reason) and I definitely don't know why.  Extension methods are also a great boost to readability without falling into the monkey-patching problem that ruby/crystal/php have (at least I think, I could be wrong).

### Go

So far I am not impressed.  I had heard that the standard library was made in a kitchen-sink style but I am not seeing it.  I am feeling that I'm writing java when I first learned it, or I'm writing python.  There seems to be no regard for developer experience in the language because I have to spell out everything.  There's no default parameters, no ternary, no string templating.  Why is this language so popular?

### Crystal

If Kotlin has become my favorite language, Crystal is definitely in second.  I love the developer experience of ruby and the static typing that I get here.  The main issue that keeps me from absolutely loving the language is that the community is very immature in terms of tooling, libraries, and basic development infrastructure.  Ironically, this is why I enjoy working in it as well because I feel like I can contribute as opposed to somewhere like Kotlin that feels like I'd have to have a Ph.D. just to open a pull request.

### PHP

People hate on PHP, and I can understand why, but I like Laravel.  I want to be able to write projects in Laravel some day.  That depends way less on understanding PHP and more on developing the maker and frontend skills that I lack.  As for the language, if I just imagine that I'm writing java without the types it feels very similar... at least writing hello world does.  The biggest gripe for PHP is that their api is not good.  If lists in a language don't have an api to get it's length, I'm immediately put off.  Why make me remember `length(arr)` when `arr.length()` is so much more discoverable?!

### Python

Python has largely the same response for me as Go.  I don't get why people like it so much.  I consistently feel like I have to write out everything.  See comment on api in the PHP section.

### Rust

I learned enough to complete a few exercises like 2 years ago and I looked at an example today and it looked completely foreign.  I'm not interested at the moment.

### OCaml

Where people see functional beauty, I see a functional mess.  A lot of statically typed functional languages seem to completely fail the squint test (at least for me anyways).
